# Internal-Best-Practices

1. Follow consistent naming conventions across services.
2. Use dependency injection where possible.
3. Write unit tests covering at least 80% of functions.
4. Prefer composition over inheritance.
5. Use async patterns for I/O heavy operations.
6. Apply retries with exponential backoff for external calls.
7. Document all public APIs with clear examples.
8. Inline comments should explain non-trivial logic.
9. Use centralized configuration management.
10. Apply SOLID principles in service design.
11. Keep functions under 50 lines whenever possible.
12. Ensure services degrade gracefully on failure.
