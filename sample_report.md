### Project Summary

The E-commerce platform suffers from several API versioning inconsistencies where services fail to implement the documented `/api/v1/` prefix requirement, and authentication response structures that deviate from the specified token format. Additionally, there are database technology mismatches between inline comments and actual implementation choices.

### Component Analysis

**Product Service**

* An inline comment on line 5 incorrectly describes the database connection as "MySQL database" when the implementation actually uses PostgreSQL (psycopg2 connector).
* The `/products` and `/products/{id}` endpoints are missing the required `/api/v1/` prefix as mandated by the project-level API versioning specification.

**Payment Service**

* The main payment processing endpoint is implemented as `/api/v1/process-payment` but the component-level documentation does not specify this exact endpoint path, creating potential confusion about the correct API interface.

**Order Service** 

* The `createOrder` endpoint is mapped to `"/"` instead of the expected `""` path, resulting in the final endpoint being `/api/v1/orders/` rather than `/api/v1/orders` as documented in the component specification.

**User Service**

* The login endpoint's `AuthResponse` record only contains an `accessToken` field, but the component-level documentation and feature specification both explicitly require returning both `accessToken` and `refreshToken` fields.
* The service is missing the required `/register` endpoint that is documented in both the feature specification and component-level documentation.
