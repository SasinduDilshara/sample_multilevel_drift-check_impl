### Project Summary

The e-commerce platform suffers from significant drift between implementation and documentation across multiple levels, including incorrect database specifications, authentication mechanism discrepancies, and misaligned service communication patterns. Cross-component drift is present where services reference incorrect endpoints and authentication methods that don't match the actual implementations.

### Component Analysis

**User Service**

* The project documentation specifies JWT tokens with 2-hour expiry, but the UserService implementation generates tokens with 3-hour expiry (180 minutes vs 120 minutes specified).
* Component documentation states authentication uses "RSA-256 signature" for JWT tokens, but the implementation uses HS256 (HMAC-SHA256) algorithm instead.
* The UserService implementation connects to a "MySQL database" according to an inline comment, but both project and component documentation specify PostgreSQL as the primary database.
* Component documentation specifies Redis caching for user profiles with 30-minute TTL, but the implementation sets cache expiry to 2700 seconds (45 minutes).
* The UserController returns "JWT token with 3-hour expiry" according to API documentation, contradicting the project-level specification of 2-hour tokens.

**Order Service**

* Project documentation states order data is "persisted in MongoDB with Redis session storage," but the component documentation specifies "Redis for cart session management and caching" - the implementation shows cart management but the project docs incorrectly describe it as session storage.
* Component documentation lists PayPal as a payment integration option, but the order service implementation only includes Stripe payment processing.
* The order handler's `notifyUserService` function incorrectly sends notifications to the user service endpoint instead of the notification service as described in the project architecture.
* Component documentation specifies five order states including CANCELLED, but the implementation in `UpdateOrderStatus` only validates transitions between PENDING, PAID, SHIPPED, and DELIVERED states.
* An inline comment in the order handler incorrectly states the method "should actually call the notification service, not user service" while the implementation attempts to call the user service.

**Notification Service**

* Component documentation states the service uses "AWS SES" for email notifications, but the email client implementation uses a generic "HTTP email service" with configurable endpoints instead of AWS SES specifically.
* The project documentation describes "push notifications for mobile applications" as a feature, but the notification service implementation only includes email and SMS functionality with no push notification support.
* Component documentation specifies "WebSocket connections" for in-app notifications, but the implementation shows no WebSocket functionality.
* The SMS client implementation includes "Twilio" integration as documented, but the email client does not implement the specified AWS SES integration.
* Component documentation claims "100 emails per minute per user" rate limiting, but the email client implementation shows no rate limiting functionality.
