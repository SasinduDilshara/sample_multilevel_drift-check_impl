### Project Summary (Overall Match: 82%)

The project contains significant documentation drift primarily manifesting in API versioning inconsistencies where some services fail to implement the mandatory `/api/v1/` prefix, and authentication response discrepancies where the user service returns incomplete token structures compared to documented specifications.

These drifts create potential integration failures between services and client applications, requiring immediate correction to ensure proper API contract adherence and system interoperability.

### Component Analysis

**Product Service - (65% Match with the documentation)**

* An inline comment on line 7 incorrectly describes the database connection as "MySQL database" when the implementation actually connects to PostgreSQL using the `psycopg2` library.
* The **GET /products** endpoint implementation lacks the mandatory `/api/v1/` prefix specified in project-level documentation, exposing endpoints directly at `/products` instead of `/api/v1/products`.
* The **GET /products/{id}** endpoint implementation lacks the mandatory `/api/v1/` prefix specified in project-level documentation, exposing the endpoint directly at `/products/<id>` instead of `/api/v1/products/{id}`.

**Payment Service - (95% Match with the documentation)**

* The **processPaymentHandler** function correctly implements the `/api/v1/process-payment` endpoint but this endpoint is not documented in any component-level or project-level documentation, creating an undocumented API surface.

**Order Service - (75% Match with the documentation)**

* The **createOrder** endpoint implementation uses a POST mapping to `/` instead of the expected `/orders` path, resulting in the actual endpoint being `/api/v1/orders/` rather than the documented `/api/v1/orders`.
* The component-level documentation specifies **GET /orders/{id}** but the implementation maps to **GET /{orderId}**, creating a parameter name inconsistency between `id` and `orderId`.

**User Service - (60% Match with the documentation)**

* The **AuthResponse** record type only includes an `accessToken` field, but the component-level documentation and feature specifications require both `accessToken` and `refreshToken` to be returned upon successful login.
* The API documentation states the login endpoint should return a 200 OK status, but the feature specification explicitly requires JWT tokens to be returned as a JSON object containing both access and refresh tokens, which the current implementation fails to provide.
