### Project Summary

The analysis identified significant documentation drift across multiple service components, with the most prevalent issues being incorrect database technology references, authentication token expiry mismatches, and outdated payment integration specifications. Cross-component communication patterns described in documentation frequently contradict the actual implementation logic, creating potential integration failures.

#### Cross-Component Drift Summary
Critical cross-component drift exists where the **Order Service** incorrectly attempts to notify the **User Service** instead of the **Notification Service**, and the **User Service** implements 3-hour JWT token expiry while project documentation specifies 2-hour expiry across all services.

### Component Analysis

**User Service**
- The component specification incorrectly states that JWT tokens use "RSA-256 signature" when the implementation uses HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256)
- Project documentation specifies 2-hour JWT token expiry, but the implementation generates tokens with 3-hour expiry
- The UserService.java file contains an inline comment stating "Check if email already exists in MySQL database" when the actual database technology is PostgreSQL as specified in project documentation
- Component documentation claims Redis caching TTL is 30 minutes, but the implementation sets cache expiry to 45 minutes (2700 seconds)

**Order Service** 
- The project documentation states orders are stored in MongoDB, but component documentation incorrectly claims "Primary storage in MongoDB for order documents" while the service connects to "ecommerce" database without explicit MongoDB configuration verification
- Component documentation mentions "PayPal integration for alternative payment methods" but no PayPal payment processing logic exists in the implementation
- The order handler contains a comment "This should actually call the notification service, not user service" with an incorrect URL "http://localhost:8080/api/users/notifications" that attempts to notify the user service instead of the notification service
- An inline comment incorrectly describes the `notifyUserService` method as calling the user service when it should call the notification service for order events

**Notification Service**
- Component documentation states email rate limiting is "100 emails per minute per user" but no rate limiting implementation exists in the email client code
- The component specification mentions "Push notifications for mobile applications" but the SMS and email client implementations do not include any push notification functionality
- Component documentation claims "WebSocket connections" for in-app notifications, but the notification service implementation only includes HTTP-based email and SMS functionality
