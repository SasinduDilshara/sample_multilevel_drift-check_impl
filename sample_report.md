# Documentation Drift Analysis Report

### Project Summary (Overall Match: 72%)

The E-commerce platform demonstrates significant documentation drift primarily concentrated in API versioning inconsistencies and incomplete implementation of documented features. Critical discrepancies exist between the project-level specifications and actual service implementations, particularly regarding authentication tokens and API endpoint structures.

### Component Analysis

**Product Service - (85% Match with the documentation)**

* The inline comment at line 5 incorrectly states "Connects to the MySQL database" when the implementation uses PostgreSQL via psycopg2
* API documentation describes pagination support with `page` and `limit` parameters, but the implementation completely ignores these query parameters in the database queries
* The `/products` endpoint lacks the required `/api/v1/` prefix specified in project-level documentation, exposing endpoints at root level instead

**Payment Service - (95% Match with the documentation)**

* Component-level documentation is missing entirely, creating drift with project-level documentation that lists payment processing as a core feature
* The inline comment at line 47 claims "This setup is fully compliant with all known documentation" but no component-level API specification exists to validate compliance

**Order Service - (70% Match with the documentation)**

* The `POST /orders` endpoint is implemented as `POST /api/v1/orders/` (with trailing slash) but component documentation specifies `POST /orders` without the API versioning prefix
* Component documentation shows request body using `items` array, but the implementation expects `CreateOrderRequest` with `getItems()` method structure
* API documentation indicates the endpoint should check inventory with product-service before order creation, but the implementation shows no such validation logic in the `createNewOrder` method

**Notification Service - (88% Match with the documentation)**

* Inline comment at line 12 claims the logging format "is compliant with the coding standards" but uses ISO format instead of the documented organization standard format

**User Service - (45% Match with the documentation)**

* Critical drift: project-level documentation mandates JWT login response must include both `accessToken` and `refreshToken`, but implementation only returns `accessToken`
* The `generateMockJwt` function comment describes returning "a base64 encoded mock JWT string" but the implementation returns a plain concatenated string without base64 encoding
