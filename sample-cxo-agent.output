### Project Summary

Overall, the APIs in the Cost Optimization Demo Project received a **"Fair"** rating. They demonstrate basic RESTful compliance, featuring secure OAuth2 authentication and sound resource modeling. However, several critical deficiencies were identified that impact enterprise-level compliance and scalability. The most significant issues include the lack of standardized error response objects, the omission of recommended REST headers like `Location`, `ETag`, and `Last-Modified`, and incomplete support for collection features such as filtering, pagination, and projection. While API versioning is present, it doesn't fully adhere to semantic versioning in the base path, posing a risk of future breaking changes. Additionally, the API documentation is missing essential support and contact details. Immediate remediation of these areas is required to achieve full WSO2 guideline compliance. On a positive note, all APIs correctly implement OAuth2 and other mandatory security schemes as per best practices.

### API Endpoint Analysis

**adeepo-kubcost - Books REST Endpoint**

This endpoint was rated **"Fair"**. It adheres to most RESTful practices with properly named resources and OAuth2-based security. However, it lacks standardized error response objects and misses crucial features like pagination and filtering on collections. It also fails to include important response headers. The versioning is visible in the server path but is not in a standard location, which could complicate future evolution.

**AdeepoKubCostTestService - Books REST Endpoint**

Also rated **"Fair"**, this API largely follows RESTful principles, using correct noun-based resource naming, standard HTTP verbs, and OAuth2 for security. Its main drawbacks are a lack of explicit versioning in the endpoint URLs, the absence of semantic error objects for 4XX responses, and the omission of key headers like `Location`, `ETag`, and `Last-Modified`. It also lacks pagination, filtering, and projection for its collections, with minor improvements needed for its documentation and error reporting.

**adeepo-3-kubecostservice - Books REST Endpoint**

This endpoint received a **"Fair"** rating for following most RESTful conventions, including correct resource naming and OAuth2 security. Its weaknesses are a lack of standardized error objects, pagination, filtering, and query capabilities for collections. It also omits important response headers such as `Location`, `ETag`, and `Last-Modified`. Although external documentation exists, it is missing contact and support information.
