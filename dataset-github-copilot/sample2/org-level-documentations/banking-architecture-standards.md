# Banking Architecture Standards

## Core Banking Architecture Principles

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
- All financial transactions must be processed through event sourcing
- Event store retention: minimum 7 years for regulatory compliance
- Real-time event streaming for fraud detection
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Event replay capabilities for system recovery

### 2. Microservices Design Patterns
- Domain-driven design with bounded contexts
- Service mesh architecture for inter-service communication
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
- Bulkhead isolation for critical services
- API gateway for external access control

### 3. Data Architecture Standards
- ACID compliance for all financial transactions
- Eventual consistency for non-transactional data
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Multi-region data replication for disaster recovery
- Real-time data analytics for risk assessment

### 4. Security Architecture
- Zero-trust security model implementation
- Multi-factor authentication for all users
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with PCI DSS and SOX regulations

### 5. Integration Patterns
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- GraphQL for complex data queries
- Message queues for asynchronous processing
- Webhook notifications for external systems
- Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms

### 6. Performance Standards
- API response time: < 200ms for 95th percentile
- Database query optimization required
- Caching strategies at multiple levels
- Load balancing across availability zones
- Auto-scaling based on demand patterns

### 7. Monitoring and Observability
- Distributed tracing for all transactions
- Comprehensive logging with structured format
- Real-time alerting for system anomalies
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Business metrics tracking and reporting

### 8. Deployment Architecture
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Canary releases for critical updates
- Infrastructure as code using Terraform
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Automated rollback mechanisms

### 9. Backup and Recovery
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Cross-region backup replication
- Regular disaster recovery testing
- RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 15 minutes
- Automated backup verification processes

### 10. Compliance Framework
- SOX compliance for financial reporting
- PCI DSS for payment card data
- GDPR for customer data protection
- Regular compliance audits and assessments
- Automated compliance monitoring tools
