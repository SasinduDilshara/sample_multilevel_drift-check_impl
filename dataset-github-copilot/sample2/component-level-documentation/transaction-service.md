# Transaction Service Documentation

## Overview
The Transaction Service handles all monetary transactions within the banking platform, including transfers, payments, deposits, and withdrawals. It ensures ACID compliance and provides real-time transaction processing with comprehensive audit trails.

## Service Architecture
- **Primary Language**: Java 17 with Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for transaction records
- **Cache**: Redis for session and temporary data
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for event publishing
- **API Style**: RESTful with OpenAPI 3.0 documentation

## Core Responsibilities
- Process money transfers between accounts
- Handle deposit and withdrawal operations
- Validate transaction limits and account balances
- Generate transaction confirmations and receipts
- Publish transaction events for downstream services
- Maintain comprehensive audit trails
- Implement fraud detection rules
- Support multi-currency transactions

## API Endpoints

### Transfer Operations
- `POST /api/v1/transactions/transfer` - Process account-to-account transfer
- `POST /api/v1/transactions/deposit` - Process cash deposit
- `POST /api/v1/transactions/withdrawal` - Process cash withdrawal
- `GET /api/v1/transactions/{transactionId}` - Get transaction details
- `GET /api/v1/accounts/{accountId}/transactions` - Get transaction history

### Transaction Management
- `PUT /api/v1/transactions/{transactionId}/cancel` - Cancel pending transaction
- `POST /api/v1/transactions/{transactionId}/reverse` - Reverse completed transaction
- `GET /api/v1/transactions/pending` - Get all pending transactions
- `POST /api/v1/transactions/batch` - Process multiple transactions

## Data Models

### Transaction Entity
```java
@Entity
public class Transaction {
    private String transactionId;
    private String fromAccountId;
    private String toAccountId;
    private BigDecimal amount;
    private String currency;
    private TransactionType type;
    private TransactionStatus status;
    private String description;
    private String reference;
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
    private LocalDateTime completedAt;
    private BigDecimal fee;
    private String failureReason;
}
```

### Transfer Request
```java
public class TransferRequest {
    private String fromAccountId;
    private String toAccountId;
    private BigDecimal amount;
    private String currency;
    private String description;
    private String reference;
    private boolean scheduledTransfer;
    private LocalDateTime scheduledDate;
}
```

## Business Rules
- Daily transfer limit: $50,000 for personal accounts
- International transfer fee: 2.5% with minimum $25
- Domestic transfer fee: $2.50 for amounts over $1,000
- Account balance must be sufficient including fees
- Transfers between same customer accounts are fee-free
- Business hours: 6 AM - 11 PM EST for same-day processing
- Weekend and holiday transfers processed next business day

## Error Handling
- Insufficient funds validation before processing
- Account status verification (active, not frozen)
- Daily limit enforcement
- Fraud detection integration
- Automatic retry for temporary failures
- Circuit breaker for external service calls

## Security Measures
- JWT token validation for all requests
- Transaction amount encryption in transit
- PCI DSS compliance for sensitive data
- Transaction signing with digital certificates
- Real-time fraud monitoring and alerts
- Two-factor authentication for high-value transfers

## Performance Requirements
- Transaction processing: < 500ms response time
- Database connection pooling with 50 connections
- Redis caching for account balances
- Kafka message publishing for audit events
- Connection timeout: 30 seconds
- Read replica for transaction history queries

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Transaction volume metrics
- Success/failure rate monitoring
- Response time tracking
- Database connection health
- Kafka producer lag monitoring
- Custom alerts for high-value transactions

## Integration Points
- **Account Service**: Balance verification and updates
- **Customer Service**: Account ownership validation
- **Notification Service**: Transaction confirmation messages
- **Fraud Service**: Risk assessment for transactions
- **Audit Service**: Comprehensive transaction logging
- **Reporting Service**: Financial reporting data

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests with database
- Contract tests with dependent services
- Load testing for peak transaction volumes
- Chaos engineering for resilience testing
- Security penetration testing

## Deployment Configuration
- Blue-green deployment for zero downtime
- Auto-scaling based on transaction volume
- Health checks for Kubernetes readiness
- Circuit breaker configuration
- Database connection pool settings
- Kafka producer/consumer configurations
