# User Service Component Documentation

## Component Overview and Architecture

The User Service is a critical microservice component responsible for managing all user-related operations including authentication, authorization, profile management, and user preferences. Built as a stateless service, it provides RESTful APIs for user registration, login, profile updates, and session management while ensuring high availability and scalability.

## Core Functionality and Responsibilities

### User Registration and Authentication
- Handles new user registration with email verification and password validation
- Implements secure password hashing using bcrypt with configurable salt rounds
- Provides OAuth 2.0 authentication endpoints with JWT token generation and validation
- Supports social login integration with Google, Facebook, and Apple identity providers
- Manages password reset functionality with secure token generation and expiration
- Implements account lockout policies to prevent brute force attacks
- Provides two-factor authentication setup and verification using TOTP algorithms
- Handles session management with concurrent session limits and automatic cleanup
- Implements rate limiting for authentication attempts to prevent abuse
- Supports single sign-on (SSO) integration with enterprise identity providers

### Profile and Preference Management
- Manages comprehensive user profile information including personal and contact details
- Provides address book functionality with validation against shipping carrier databases
- Handles user preference management for notifications, communications, and privacy settings
- Implements role-based access control with granular permission assignment
- Manages merchant account information and business profile data for seller accounts
- Provides user activity tracking and audit logging for compliance requirements
- Handles account deactivation and deletion with GDPR-compliant data erasure
- Implements user segmentation and tagging for marketing and analytics purposes
- Manages user-generated content such as reviews, ratings, and wishlist items
- Provides data export functionality for user data portability requirements

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema and Data Models
- Utilizes PostgreSQL database with optimized indexing for high-performance queries
- Implements database connection pooling with configurable pool sizes and timeout settings
- Uses database migrations for schema versioning and deployment automation
- Implements row-level security policies for multi-tenant data isolation
- Utilizes read replicas for read-heavy operations to improve performance
- Implements database backup and point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Uses database triggers for audit logging and automatic timestamp management
- Implements soft deletion patterns for data retention and compliance requirements
- Utilizes JSON columns for flexible user preference and metadata storage
- Implements database constraint validation for data integrity enforcement

### Security and Compliance Framework
- Implements field-level encryption for sensitive user data using AES-256 encryption
- Provides comprehensive audit logging for all user actions and data modifications
- Implements input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Uses parameterized queries and ORM to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Implements output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- Provides GDPR compliance features including consent management and data portability
- Implements data retention policies with automatic data purging for expired records
- Uses secure random number generation for tokens, passwords, and cryptographic operations
- Implements rate limiting and DDoS protection for all public endpoints
- Provides security headers and CORS configuration for web application protection

### Performance and Scalability Optimizations
- Implements Redis caching for frequently accessed user data and session information
- Uses database query optimization with proper indexing and query analysis
- Implements asynchronous processing for non-critical operations using message queues
- Provides horizontal scaling capabilities with stateless service architecture
- Implements connection pooling for database and external service connections
- Uses CDN integration for static assets and profile images
- Implements lazy loading and pagination for large data sets
- Provides batch processing capabilities for bulk user operations
- Uses compression for API responses to reduce bandwidth usage
- Implements health check endpoints for load balancer and monitoring integration

## API Interface and Integration Points

### RESTful API Endpoints
- POST /api/v1/users/register - User registration with email verification
- POST /api/v1/users/login - User authentication with session creation
- GET /api/v1/users/profile - Retrieve current user profile information
- PUT /api/v1/users/profile - Update user profile with validation
- POST /api/v1/users/password/reset - Initiate password reset process
- PUT /api/v1/users/password - Change user password with current password verification
- GET /api/v1/users/addresses - Retrieve user address book
- POST /api/v1/users/addresses - Add new address with validation
- GET /api/v1/users/preferences - Retrieve user preferences and settings
- PUT /api/v1/users/preferences - Update user preferences with validation

### External Service Integrations
- Email service integration for verification emails and password reset notifications
- SMS gateway integration for two-factor authentication and account notifications
- Social media platform APIs for social login and profile information retrieval
- Payment gateway integration for storing secure payment method references
- Analytics service integration for user behavior tracking and segmentation
- Notification service integration for push notifications and communication preferences
- Identity verification service integration for enhanced security and compliance
- Geolocation service integration for address validation and fraud prevention
- CRM system integration for customer data synchronization and marketing automation
- Audit logging service integration for compliance and security monitoring

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Publishes user registration events for welcome email and onboarding workflows
- Publishes user profile update events for data synchronization across services
- Publishes authentication events for security monitoring and analytics
- Publishes account deletion events for cleanup and compliance processing
- Subscribes to order events for user activity tracking and engagement scoring
- Subscribes to payment events for user financial activity and risk assessment
- Publishes preference change events for personalization and recommendation engines
- Subscribes to security events for account protection and fraud prevention
- Publishes session events for concurrent session management and security monitoring
- Implements event sourcing patterns for audit trail and state reconstruction
