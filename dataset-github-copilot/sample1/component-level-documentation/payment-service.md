# Payment Service Component Documentation

## Component Architecture and Service Boundaries

The Payment Service is a highly secure and PCI DSS compliant microservice responsible for processing all financial transactions within the e-commerce platform. It abstracts payment gateway complexities, implements comprehensive fraud detection, and ensures secure handling of sensitive financial data while maintaining high availability and performance.

## Security Framework and Compliance

### PCI DSS Compliance Implementation
- Implements strict cardholder data environment (CDE) isolation with network segmentation
- Uses tokenization for all sensitive payment data to minimize PCI scope
- Implements field-level encryption for payment information using AES-256 encryption
- Maintains comprehensive audit logging for all payment-related activities and access
- Implements secure key management with hardware security modules (HSM)
- Uses secure coding practices with regular security code reviews and vulnerability assessments
- Implements data retention policies compliant with PCI DSS requirements
- Maintains network security with firewalls, intrusion detection, and access controls
- Implements regular security testing including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
- Provides employee security training and access management for payment system access

### Fraud Detection and Risk Management
- Implements machine learning-based fraud detection with real-time transaction scoring
- Uses velocity checking to detect suspicious transaction patterns and account takeover attempts
- Implements geolocation validation to detect transactions from unusual locations
- Uses device fingerprinting to identify potentially fraudulent devices and sessions
- Implements transaction limits and controls based on customer risk profiles
- Uses address verification service (AVS) and card verification value (CVV) validation
- Implements 3D Secure authentication for enhanced cardholder verification
- Uses blacklist and whitelist management for merchants, customers, and payment methods
- Implements manual review workflows for high-risk transactions
- Provides real-time fraud alerts and automated risk response mechanisms

## Payment Gateway Integration and Management

### Multi-Gateway Architecture
- Supports multiple payment gateways including Stripe, PayPal, Square, and regional providers
- Implements intelligent gateway routing based on transaction type, amount, and customer location
- Uses gateway failover mechanisms to ensure payment processing continuity
- Implements cost optimization through gateway fee comparison and routing decisions
- Supports different payment methods including credit cards, digital wallets, and bank transfers
- Implements currency conversion and multi-currency support for international transactions
- Uses webhook processing for real-time payment status updates and reconciliation
- Implements gateway-specific error handling and retry mechanisms
- Supports sandbox and production environment management for testing and deployment
- Implements gateway performance monitoring and SLA tracking

### Transaction Processing and State Management
- Implements comprehensive transaction lifecycle management from authorization to settlement
- Uses state machine patterns for transaction status tracking and workflow management
- Implements transaction retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Uses idempotency handling to prevent duplicate transaction processing
- Implements partial payment support for large transactions and installment plans
- Uses authorization hold management with automatic capture and void capabilities
- Implements refund and chargeback processing with automated dispute management
- Uses settlement reporting and reconciliation with gateway and bank statements
- Implements currency exchange rate management for international transactions
- Provides real-time transaction monitoring and alerting for operational issues

### Payment Method Management
- Supports secure storage of payment methods using tokenization and vault services
- Implements payment method validation including card verification and account validation
- Uses recurring payment support for subscription and automatic billing scenarios
- Implements payment method expiration tracking and automatic update services
- Supports alternative payment methods including digital wallets and buy-now-pay-later services
- Uses payment method routing based on customer preferences and transaction characteristics
- Implements payment method risk scoring and fraud prevention measures
- Supports payment method metadata management for customer preferences and usage analytics
- Implements payment method compliance with regional regulations and requirements
- Provides payment method analytics and reporting for business intelligence

## Service Interface and API Architecture

### RESTful API Design and Security
- POST /api/v1/payments/process - Process payment with comprehensive validation and fraud checking
- GET /api/v1/payments/{id} - Retrieve payment details with proper authorization and data filtering
- POST /api/v1/payments/{id}/refund - Process refund with validation and gateway coordination
- GET /api/v1/payments/methods - List customer payment methods with tokenized data
- POST /api/v1/payments/methods - Add new payment method with validation and tokenization
- DELETE /api/v1/payments/methods/{id} - Remove payment method with secure data deletion
- GET /api/v1/payments/transactions - List transactions with filtering and pagination
- POST /api/v1/payments/webhooks - Handle gateway webhooks with signature verification
- GET /api/v1/payments/reports - Generate payment reports with access control
- POST /api/v1/payments/verify - Verify payment status with gateway reconciliation

### Event-Driven Integration Patterns
- Publishes payment authorized events for order processing and inventory allocation
- Publishes payment completed events for order fulfillment and customer notifications
- Publishes payment failed events for order cancellation and customer communication
- Subscribes to order events for payment processing initiation and coordination
- Publishes refund processed events for order management and customer notifications
- Subscribes to fraud detection events for transaction blocking and investigation
- Publishes chargeback events for dispute management and customer service coordination
- Subscribes to customer events for payment method management and risk assessment
- Publishes payment method events for customer preference updates and analytics
- Implements event sourcing for transaction audit trail and compliance reporting

### Data Models and Business Logic
- Payment transaction entity with comprehensive metadata and status tracking
- Payment method entity with tokenized data and customer associations
- Refund entity with reason codes and processing status information
- Fraud score entity with risk factors and detection algorithm results
- Gateway response entity with detailed response codes and error information
- Settlement entity with batch processing and reconciliation data
- Chargeback entity with dispute information and response workflows
- Payment configuration entity with gateway settings and routing rules
- Currency entity with exchange rates and conversion factors
- Payment analytics entity with transaction metrics and performance indicators
