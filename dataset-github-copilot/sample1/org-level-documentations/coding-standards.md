# Organizational Coding Standards

## 1. General Programming Principles
- All functions must have a maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10
- Every function must be documented with appropriate API documentation following language-specific conventions
- Variable names must use camelCase for local variables and PascalCase for constants
- All error handling must be explicit and use structured error types
- Logging must be implemented at INFO level for all business operations
- Database operations must always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- All API endpoints must implement proper authentication and authorization
- Code coverage must be maintained at minimum 85% for all services

## 2. Security Requirements
- All sensitive data must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption
- API keys and secrets must never be hardcoded in source code
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized before processing
- Password hashing must use bcrypt with minimum salt rounds of 12
- Session tokens must expire within 24 hours for regular users
- All external API calls must implement timeout mechanisms (max 30 seconds)
- SQL queries must use prepared statements exclusively
- File uploads must be scanned for malicious content

## 3. Performance Standards
- All database queries must execute within 100ms for simple operations
- API response times must not exceed 2 seconds for any endpoint
- Memory usage per service instance must not exceed 512MB
- CPU usage should remain below 70% under normal load
- All services must implement connection pooling for database connections
- Caching must be implemented for frequently accessed data (>10 requests/minute)
- Image processing operations must be optimized for batch processing
- Large file operations must implement streaming to avoid memory overflow

## 4. Code Structure Requirements
- Each microservice must be contained in its own directory
- Configuration files must be separated from source code
- Environment-specific configurations must use environment variables
- All services must implement health check endpoints
- Dependency injection must be used for all external service dependencies
- Business logic must be separated from controller/routing logic
- Data access layer must be abstracted through repository patterns
- All services must implement graceful shutdown procedures

## 5. Documentation Standards
- All public functions must have comprehensive API documentation
- README files must be present in each service directory
- Architecture decisions must be documented in ADR format
- Database schema changes must be documented with migration scripts
- API endpoints must be documented using OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Code comments must explain the 'why' not the 'what'
- Complex algorithms must include time and space complexity analysis
- Integration points between services must be clearly documented

## 6. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests must cover all business logic functions
- Integration tests must verify service-to-service communication
- End-to-end tests must cover critical user journeys
- Performance tests must validate response time requirements
- Security tests must verify authentication and authorization
- Database tests must verify data integrity constraints
- Error handling tests must cover all exception scenarios
- Mock services must be used for external dependencies in tests

## 7. Deployment and Operations
- All services must be containerized using Docker
- Container images must use multi-stage builds for optimization
- Services must implement structured logging in JSON format
- Monitoring endpoints must expose Prometheus-compatible metrics
- All services must support horizontal scaling
- Database migrations must be automated and reversible
- Blue-green deployment strategy must be supported
- Rollback procedures must be documented and tested

## 8. Code Review Process
- All code changes must go through peer review before merging
- Security-sensitive changes require security team approval
- Performance-critical changes require load testing
- Database schema changes require DBA review
- API changes require API design review
- Breaking changes require architectural review
- Code review checklist must be completed for all reviews
- Automated security scanning must pass before deployment
