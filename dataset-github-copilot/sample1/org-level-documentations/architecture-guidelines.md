# Architecture Guidelines and Best Practices

## 1. Microservices Architecture Principles
- Each microservice must own its data and database schema exclusively
- Service boundaries must be defined based on business capabilities and domains
- Inter-service communication must use asynchronous messaging where possible
- Synchronous communication must be limited to real-time user-facing operations
- Event-driven architecture must be implemented for cross-service notifications
- Circuit breaker patterns must be implemented for all external service calls
- Service mesh implementation must handle service-to-service communication
- API versioning strategy must support backward compatibility for minimum 2 versions
- Distributed tracing must be implemented across all services for observability
- Each service must implement its own business logic without cross-dependencies

## 2. Data Management and Consistency
- Database per service pattern must be strictly followed
- Eventual consistency model must be accepted for cross-service data operations
- Saga pattern must be implemented for distributed transactions
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) should be used for complex domains
- Event sourcing must be considered for audit-heavy business processes
- Data replication must be implemented only when absolutely necessary
- Master data management must be centralized for reference data
- Data synchronization must use event-driven mechanisms
- Database migrations must be backward compatible and reversible
- Data partitioning strategies must be implemented for large datasets

## 3. API Design and Integration Standards
- RESTful API design must follow Richardson Maturity Model Level 3
- GraphQL must be used for complex data fetching requirements
- API endpoints must implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Request and response schemas must be validated using JSON Schema
- API documentation must be generated automatically from code annotations
- Hypermedia controls must be included in REST responses where applicable
- Content negotiation must support multiple response formats (JSON, XML)
- API versioning must use semantic versioning principles
- Rate limiting and throttling must be implemented at API gateway level
- API security must implement OAuth 2.0 with appropriate scopes

## 4. Performance and Scalability Architecture
- Horizontal scaling must be the primary scaling strategy for all services
- Caching strategies must be implemented at multiple levels (application, database, CDN)
- Database connection pooling must be optimized for concurrent access patterns
- Load balancing must distribute traffic based on service health and capacity
- Auto-scaling policies must be configured based on CPU, memory, and request metrics
- Content Delivery Network (CDN) must be used for static assets and media files
- Database read replicas must be used for read-heavy operations
- Asynchronous processing must be used for time-consuming operations
- Memory management must prevent memory leaks and optimize garbage collection
- Performance monitoring must track response times, throughput, and error rates

## 5. Security Architecture Framework
- Zero Trust security model must be implemented across all service communications
- Defense in depth strategy must include multiple security layers
- Identity and access management must be centralized using OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect
- Secrets management must use dedicated vault solutions with rotation policies
- Network segmentation must isolate services based on security zones
- Encryption in transit must use TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Encryption at rest must be implemented for all persistent data storage
- Security scanning must be integrated into CI/CD pipelines
- Threat modeling must be conducted for all new features and services
- Security monitoring must include anomaly detection and alerting

## 6. DevOps and Deployment Architecture
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) must be used for all environment provisioning
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) must be fully automated
- Blue-green deployment strategy must be supported for zero-downtime releases
- Canary releases must be used for gradual feature rollouts
- Feature flags must be implemented for runtime feature toggling
- Container orchestration must use Kubernetes with proper resource management
- Service mesh must handle traffic management, security, and observability
- Monitoring and logging must be centralized using observability platforms
- Backup and disaster recovery must be automated with regular testing
- Environment consistency must be maintained across development, staging, and production

## 7. Observability and Monitoring Standards
- Distributed tracing must correlate requests across all service boundaries
- Structured logging must use JSON format with standardized field names
- Metrics collection must follow Prometheus exposition format
- Health checks must be implemented at application and infrastructure levels
- Error tracking must provide detailed stack traces and context information
- Performance profiling must be available for troubleshooting performance issues
- Business metrics must be tracked alongside technical metrics
- Alerting rules must be configured for both technical and business KPIs
- Dashboards must provide real-time visibility into system health and performance
- Log retention policies must balance storage costs with compliance requirements

## 8. Technology Stack and Tool Selection
- Technology choices must align with organizational expertise and support capabilities
- Open source solutions must be preferred over proprietary alternatives when suitable
- Programming language selection must consider team skills and ecosystem maturity
- Database technology must match data access patterns and consistency requirements
- Message queue selection must support required throughput and durability guarantees
- Container registry must support security scanning and vulnerability management
- Orchestration platform must provide required scalability and reliability features
- Monitoring tools must integrate with existing observability infrastructure
- Development tools must support collaborative development and code quality
- Third-party service evaluations must include security, compliance, and vendor assessments
