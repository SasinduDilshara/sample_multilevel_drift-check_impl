# E-Commerce Platform API Specification

## API Overview and Design Principles

The E-Commerce Platform API follows RESTful design principles and implements a comprehensive set of endpoints to support all platform functionality. The API is designed with developer experience in mind, providing consistent response formats, comprehensive error handling, and extensive documentation.

## Authentication and Authorization Framework

### OAuth 2.0 Implementation
- All API endpoints require valid OAuth 2.0 access tokens for authentication
- JWT token format with 24-hour expiration and automatic refresh capability
- Scope-based authorization system allowing granular access control for different API operations
- Support for multiple client types including web applications, mobile apps, and server-to-server integrations
- Rate limiting implemented per client with different limits based on subscription tier
- API key authentication available for server-to-server integrations and webhook endpoints
- Multi-factor authentication required for administrative operations and sensitive data access
- Session management with concurrent session limits and automatic logout after inactivity
- Role-based access control with predefined roles and custom permission assignment
- Audit logging for all authentication attempts and authorization decisions

### Security Requirements
- All API communications must use HTTPS with TLS 1.3 encryption
- Request signing using HMAC-SHA256 for high-security operations
- Input validation and sanitization for all request parameters and payload data
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries and ORM usage
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection through proper output encoding
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection using anti-CSRF tokens
- API versioning strategy to maintain backward compatibility while introducing new features
- Error response sanitization to prevent information disclosure through error messages
- Request timeout enforcement to prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- Geographic IP blocking and whitelist support for enhanced security

## Data Models and Response Formats

### Standardized Response Structure
- Consistent JSON response format across all endpoints with standard metadata fields
- Pagination support using cursor-based and offset-based pagination methods
- Error response format with detailed error codes, messages, and resolution guidance
- HTTP status code usage following standard conventions for different operation outcomes
- Response caching headers for optimal performance and reduced server load
- Content negotiation support for different response formats (JSON, XML)
- Compression support using gzip and brotli algorithms for bandwidth optimization
- CORS support with configurable allowed origins, methods, and headers
- Response time optimization with lazy loading and selective field inclusion
- API versioning in response headers and URL structure for backward compatibility

### Data Validation and Constraints
- Input validation using JSON Schema with comprehensive validation rules
- Business rule validation including inventory checks, pricing validation, and constraint verification
- Data type validation with automatic type coercion where appropriate
- String length limits and pattern matching for text fields and identifiers
- Numeric range validation for quantities, prices, and measurement values
- Date and time validation with timezone handling and format standardization
- Email and phone number validation with international format support
- File upload validation including size limits, type restrictions, and malware scanning
- Referential integrity checks for foreign key relationships and dependencies
- Custom validation rules for business-specific requirements and compliance standards
