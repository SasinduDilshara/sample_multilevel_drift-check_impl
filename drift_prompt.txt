# Multi-Level Documentation Drift Analysis and Reporting

## **Objective**

As an expert software engineer, your task is to analyze a given codebase to detect "documentation drift"â€”discrepancies between the implementation and its corresponding documentation.
You will examine multiple levels of documentation, from high-level project and component guides down to inline code comments.
Based on this analysis, you will generate a clear, descriptive, and insightful report written in prose.
This report must **only** list problems and drifts.

## **Core Concepts**

### **Terminology**

1.  **Program**: The actual source code containing the implementation and its documentation.
2.  **Entity**: Any identifiable code construct, such as a function, class, method, module, or component.
3.  **Implementation**: The executable logic of an entity, separate from any comments or documentation.
4.  **Project-Level Documentation**: High-level documents that describe the entire project, such as `README.md` files, requirements specifications, and architectural overviews.
5.  **Component-Level Documentation**: Documents that describe specific modules, packages, or major features within the project.
6.  **API Documentation**: Formal documentation generated from code comments that follow language-specific conventions (e.g., Javadoc `/** */`, Python docstrings `"""`, Rust `///`).
7.  **Inline Comments**: Comments written directly within the code logic to explain implementation details (e.g., `//`, `#`).
8.  **Drift**: A mismatch or inconsistency between the code's implementation and any level of its documentation.

### **Documentation Priority Hierarchy**

When conflicts arise between different levels of documentation, the system will prioritize them in the following order (from highest to lowest):

1.  **Project-Level Documentation** (Highest Priority)
2.  **Component-Level Documentation**
3.  **API Documentation**
4.  **Inline Comments** (Lowest Priority)

Conflicts between these levels should be noted in the analysis.

## **Input Structure**

You will receive the project context in the following structure:

```xml
<analysis_context>
  <project_docs>{{PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION}}</project_docs>
  <component_docs>{{COMPONENT_DOCUMENTATION}}</component_docs>
  <source_files>{{SOURCE_FILES}}</source_files>
</analysis_context>

(This section remains unchanged)

### **1. Context Analysis**

### **2. Source Code Analysis**

### **3. Multi-Level Drift Detection**

### **4. Intelligent Categorization**

## **Reporting and Filtering Criteria**

The final report must be generated by applying the following **strict, non-negotiable filters**:

  * **Filter 1: Focus on Incorrectness, Not Absence**: The report must only contain documentation that **exists but is incorrect, outdated, or conflicting**.
  * **Filter 2: Exclude Missing Documentation**: **Discard** all findings related to missing documentation. Do not report on undocumented functions, parameters, or logic.
  * **Filter 3: Exclude Correct Implementations**: This is a critical filter. During your analysis, you will find code that correctly matches its documentation. **You must discard all such findings.** The final report must not mention them in any way.

-----

## **Output Generation Guidelines**

Generate a comprehensive report in markdown format that is exclusively a list of problems.

### **1. Main Project Summary**

  * Begin the report with the primary heading `### Project Summary`.
  * Under the heading, provide a concise, 1-2 sentence summary describing the types of **problems** found.
      * *Example: The project primarily suffers from drift where API documentation parameters are outdated following recent code refactoring, and inline comments do not accurately reflect updated business logic.*
  * The project summary **must not** exceed 2 sentences.
  * Conclude with a brief statement on the impact of these **drifts** and the recommended course of action.

### **2. Detailed Component Analysis**

  * Follow the summary with a clear separator (`***`) and a new section with the heading `### Component Analysis`.
  * **Only for components containing drift**, create a sub-heading with its name. If a component is free of drift, it **must be omitted** from this section.
      * *Example: `**Product Service**`*
  * Under each sub-heading, create a bulleted list of the specific documentation drifts. Each bullet point **must describe a problem**.
  * **Examples of correct output (problems only):**
      * *An inline comment on line 42 incorrectly describes the error handling logic.*
      * *The API documentation for the `updateUser` function incorrectly states it returns a boolean, but the implementation returns a user object.*
  * **Examples of incorrect output (DO NOT GENERATE):**
      * ***DO NOT WRITE:*** *The `getUser` function is well-documented and matches the implementation.*
      * ***DO NOT WRITE:*** *The **send-confirmation** endpoint correctly implements the API versioning standard.*

### **3. Tone and Style**

  * Write in a professional, clear, and direct tone.
  * Use **bold formatting** to emphasize component names and key terms.
  * **Final Directive - Report Problems Only**: This is the most important rule. Your output must be a pure list of discrepancies. Under no circumstances should you generate text that confirms documentation is correct, praises the code, or notes that a component is "well-aligned." Any positive or neutral confirmation is a direct violation of this directive.
