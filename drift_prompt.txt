# Multi-Level Documentation Drift Analysis and Reporting

## **Objective**

As an expert software engineer, your task is to analyze a given codebase to detect "documentation drift"â€”discrepancies between the implementation and its corresponding documentation. You will examine multiple levels of documentation, from high-level project and component guides down to inline code comments. Based on this analysis, you will generate a clear, descriptive, and insightful report written in prose. This report should summarize the overall health of the project's documentation and detail specific issues within its components, providing actionable feedback in a narrative format.

## **Core Concepts**

### **Terminology**

1.  **Program**: The actual source code containing the implementation and its documentation.
2.  **Entity**: Any identifiable code construct, such as a function, class, method, module, or component.
3.  **Implementation**: The executable logic of an entity, separate from any comments or documentation.
4.  **Project-Level Documentation**: High-level documents that describe the entire project, such as `README.md` files, requirements specifications, and architectural overviews.
5.  **Component-Level Documentation**: Documents that describe specific modules, packages, or major features within the project.
6.  **API Documentation**: Formal documentation generated from code comments that follow language-specific conventions (e.g., Javadoc `/** */`, Python docstrings `"""`, Rust `///`).
7.  **Inline Comments**: Comments written directly within the code logic to explain implementation details (e.g., `//`, `#`).
8.  **Drift**: A mismatch or inconsistency between the code's implementation and any level of its documentation.

### **Documentation Priority Hierarchy**

When conflicts arise between different levels of documentation, the system will prioritize them in the following order (from highest to lowest):

1.  **Project-Level Documentation** (Highest Priority)
2.  **Component-Level Documentation**
3.  **API Documentation**
4.  **Inline Comments** (Lowest Priority)

Conflicts between these levels should be noted in the analysis.

## **Input Structure**

You will receive the project context in the following structure:

```xml
<analysis_context>
  <project_docs>{{PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION}}</project_docs>
  <component_docs>{{COMPONENT_DOCUMENTATION}}</component_docs>
  <source_files>{{SOURCE_FILES}}</source_files>
</analysis_context>
```

## **Analysis Process (Internal Steps)**

You will perform the following analysis internally to gather the insights needed for the final report.

### **1. Context Analysis**

  * Parse and comprehend the **project-level documentation** (requirements, READMEs) to understand the project's goals and specifications.
  * Parse and comprehend the **component-level documentation** to understand the intended purpose and design of individual modules.
  * Establish the documentation hierarchy and identify any high-level conflicts between project and component docs.

### **2. Source Code Analysis**

  * For each source file, automatically detect the programming language and its specific documentation conventions (e.g., `/** */` vs. `"""`).
  * Identify all code entities (functions, classes, etc.) and extract their associated documentation (API docs and inline comments).

### **3. Multi-Level Drift Detection**

  * For each code entity, systematically compare its implementation against all relevant documentation layers to identify drift.
      * **Project-Level Drift**: Does the implemented feature align with the project's `README` and requirements?
      * **Component-Level Drift**: Does the entity's behavior match the description in its component documentation?
      * **API Documentation Drift**: Are the parameters, return values, and described behavior in the API docs accurate?
      * **Inline Comment Drift**: Do the inline comments correctly reflect the logic they are intended to explain?

### **4. Intelligent Categorization**

* Internally categorize each detected issue by its **severity** (Critical, Major, Minor), **type** (Missing, Outdated, Incorrect, Conflicting), and the **documentation level** it occurred at. This categorization will inform the tone and focus of the final report.

## **Output Generation Guidelines**

Generate a comprehensive report in markdown format. The report must be structured as a clear, scannable list of documentation drift issues.

### **1. Main Project Summary**

* Begin the report with a primary heading: `### Project Summary`.
* Assign an overall rating for the project's documentation health (e.g., **"Fair"**, **"Needs Improvement"**).
* Under the heading, create a bulleted list highlighting the most critical, project-wide documentation drifts.
* Each bullet point should be a short sentence that clearly identifies a systemic issue.
* Conclude with a brief statement on the overall impact of the identified drifts and the recommended course of action.

### **2. Detailed Component Analysis**

* Follow the summary with a clear separator (`***`) and a new section with the heading `### Component Analysis`.
* For each component, endpoint, or file analyzed, create a dedicated sub-heading that includes its name and an individual rating (e.g., `**MyService - REST Endpoint (Fair)**`).
* Under each sub-heading, create a bulleted list of all specific documentation drifts found within that component.
* Each bullet point must be a short, direct sentence describing a single, actionable issue.
    * *Example: API documentation for the `createUser` function is missing a description for the `role` parameter.*
    * *Example: An inline comment on line 42 incorrectly describes the error handling logic.*

### **3. Tone and Style**

* Write in a professional, clear, and direct tone.
* Use **bold formatting** to emphasize component names, ratings, and key terms within the issues.
* The final output must be a clear and scannable list of actionable issues, focusing only on the identified drifts.
